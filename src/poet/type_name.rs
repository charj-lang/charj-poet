/**
 * Any type in Java's type system, plus {@code void}. This class is an identifier for primitive
 * types like {@code int} and raw reference types like {@code String} and {@code List}. It also
 * identifies composite types like {@code char[]} and {@code Set<Long>}.
 *
 * <p>Type names are dumb identifiers only and do not model the values they name. For example, the
 * type name for {@code java.util.List} doesn't know about the {@code size()} method, the fact that
 * lists are collections, or even that it accepts a single type parameter.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are immutable value objects that implement {@code equals()} and {@code
 * hashCode()} properly.
 *
 * <h3>Referencing existing types</h3>
 *
 * <p>Primitives and void are constants that you can reference directly: see {@link #INT}, {@link
 * #DOUBLE}, and {@link #VOID}.
 *
 * <p>In an annotation processor you can get a type name instance for a type mirror by calling
 * {@link #get(TypeMirror)}. In reflection code, you can use {@link #get(Type)}.
 *
 * <h3>Defining new types</h3>
 *
 * <p>Create new reference types like {@code com.example.HelloWorld} with {@link
 * ClassName#get(String, String, String...)}. To build composite types like {@code char[]} and
 * {@code Set<Long>}, use the factory methods on {@link ArrayTypeName}, {@link
 * ParameterizedTypeName}, {@link TypeVariableName}, and {@link WildcardTypeName}.
